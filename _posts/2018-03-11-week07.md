## Events

The 2 events I attended are Data Through Design and NYC Open Data Week. 

### Data Through Design
I attended the Opening Reception on March 2. There were free drinks and a lot of people, despite the snow storm outside. The place was a lot smaller than I had originally imagined it to be. There were a couple of innovative exhibits that portrayed data in interesting ways. My favorite was the Haiku generating machine, as it was amusing and accurate. It would generate haikus on NYC government jobs when someone pushes a button and print out the haikus on stickers. An example haiku generated for Public Health Assistant was "Explain testing and clinical procedures to customers patients". Another exhibit that I found interesting was sexual violence in NYC over time. The data came from NYPD Compliant Data Historic and it was portrayed on a giant wooden board with a clock representing the time of day. There were LED lights that lit up to represent when the sex crime happened. It was fairly big compared to the other exhibits. The other exhibits were interesting and it was nice to be able to get to see all of them. 

### NYC Open Data Week @ NYU
I attended the NYC Open Data Week on March 5. The panel was interesting and I liked how the panelists each had different occupations. I learned a lot of interesting information during the panel. One particular question that stuck with me was how we knew that the data the government provides is legitimate. The story that came along with this question was interesting. It was funny learning that a hip transplant was not around $700 but more expensive than that. It was nice to know that with open data, there are people who are going to look at it and notice the mistakes and can point out the errors. The panel also helped me understand more about the importance of Open Data. If data is open, people would not need to waste time researching something that someone else had already researched. More time can be spent on adding to the existing research, or developing new research based off of the existing research. The entire panel was interesting and insightful. I did not know NYU had data services, so it was cool to find out about it.
