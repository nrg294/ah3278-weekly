## According to the Merrian Webster dictionary, the definition of the word humanitarian (adj) is "relating to or characteristic of people who work to improve the lives and living conditions of other people". Consider the open source projects that you are familiar with (not necessarily the one that you are working on in this class). Could any of them be classified as humanitarian or having humanitarian aspect? Explain.   
Some of the open source projects that I am familiar with would be classified as humanitarian. One of the projects that I evaluated in class was OpenMRS, which is notably humanitarian. OpenMRS's mission is to improve health care delivery in developing countries. This project embodies the very definition of humanitarian as the OpenMRS community is trying to "improve the lives and living conditions of other people" by providing them with access to a medical record system.  

Generally, I believe that open sourcing projects are done with good intentions. While some projects aren't open sourced to be humanitarian, they do contain humanitarian aspects. Open source projects such as atom is not humanitarian, but it does contain humanitarian aspects. While atom does not improve the lives of people on a large scale, I believe that it improves the lives of people in a more subtle manner. As atom is designed to be a hackable editor, it essentially "improves" the lives of people who are frustrated by the rigidity of other editors. I believe that working with something you like, rather than something that frustrates you, is definitely an improvement on your life.

## Report on the progress that your group made for your project  
The progress our group made this week was a good start. We were able to get through some of the milestones that we created in class on Tuesday. We updated our fork for PDF.js project, was able to join the IRC channel, read through the style guide, learned how to run PDF.js with gulp, went through the walkthrough and updated our milestones. 

## What is the next thing that you (as an individual) will be working on (as part of your team project)?
For me, I plan on looking through closed issues and old pull requests, especially ones with code in them to get a better feel of the code and to gain a better understanding of how certain issues/bugs are fixed. I also plan on triaging for more bugs that our group can tackle. 

## Contributions
