## Questions for Danna
1. What made you interested in Open Source?
2. Did you join Google knowing that you wanted to work with Open Source or were you randomly placed?
3. Do you work on any Open Source Projects outside of Google?
4. What is your most favorite Open Source Project?

## Progress on Group Project
Our group joined the IRC. I tried messaging the group by asking a question, but received no response. Three of us (Dora, Ola, Me), worked on looking at the code to understand the code structure better. Suyasha was looking for possible issues for us to work on because she already examined the code base. Ryan was looking through open and closed issues. I am able to actively participate in what the group is working on as I have been attending group meetings and making progress on milestones in class and outside of class. My current specific task in the work on the project is to get use to the code base so that we can find issues that we would have no problems fixing.
