## Issue Pull Request
[Link to Pull Request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/56)

To complete the fix, I executed these steps: 
1. I cloned the original repo (git clone https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git)
2. I forked the repo to my repository by clicking on the Fork button in https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18
3. I added the fork address as the remote for my local repository (git remote add myfork https://github.com/ashley-hu/cs480_s18.git)
4. I checked my managed repositories to ensure I had everything (git remote -v) 
5. I created a new branch called fix_typo (git branch fix_typo) 
6. I switched to the newly created branch (git checkout fix_typo)
7. I proceeded to locate the file with the error and fix the typo in 03.markdown with vim 
8. I checked to see the current state of the working directory/staging area (git status)
9. I added the file I edited (git add 03.markdown)
10. I committed the file with a message (git commit -m 'fixed typo to RedHat')
11. I pushed the change to my fork (git push -u myfork fix_typo) 
12. I was then able to issue a pull request from my pushed changes in GitHub
