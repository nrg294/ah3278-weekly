# Team Assessment and Plan

## Strengths and Weaknesses
Overall, the strength of our group is being able to fix issues as we are all familiar with javascript. In everyone's blogs, they all indicated how they can solve bugs using their own unique attribute. However, our weakness is communication. Since we all live far away from one another and have a different set of schedules, it is hard to meet up and get immediate responses from people. I find myself fairly responsive as I am always checking my messages hourly, but when having a group discussion online, it sometimes takes a good while until everyone responds to the question. While it does take a while, the task would eventually get done. In a way, our strength can also be that we are responsible. 

## Meeting Time
For our group (PDF.js), we decided that our common meeting time will be on Wednesdays from 5pm-7pm. The alternative meeting time will be on Saturdays from 4pm-6pm. 

## List of Milestones
* Get familiar with the code and get familiar with how PDF.js works by getting the code and following the interactive example
* Look through the documentation on how to contribute and understand how it should be done
* Start interacting with the community by joining the IRC channel
* Attempt to fix beginner bugs and eventually move on to more advanced bugs
