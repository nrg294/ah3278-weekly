I wanted to contribute to something I had a passion for. After looking through various articles, I finally settled upon Love Live! Sunshine!! after reading through it and noticing grammar errors and a date formatting error. At first, I did not notice anything out of the ordinary as the Wikipedia page did not have a maintenance template that said the article may need help for grammar, spelling, unreferenced links, tone, etc. When I entered the Talk section of the article, there was also no discussion on what needs to be fixed. However, the revision history shows that the article has been actively edited as there has been at least a couple of edits every week as can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Love_Live!_Sunshine!!&action=history).  

The contributions that I made include editing an invalid date format (which I found in the References section) and editing the grammar of a paragraph (which I found in the Plot section).
