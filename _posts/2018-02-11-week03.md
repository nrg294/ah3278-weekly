I wanted to contribute to something I had a passion for. After looking through various articles, I finally settled upon Love Live! Sunshine!! because I noticed a date formatting error and some grammar errors. At first, I thought the article did not have any issues as I did not see a maintenance template that said the article may need help with grammar, spelling, unreferenced links, tone, etc. When I entered the Talk section of the article, there was also no discussion on what needs to be fixed. However, the revision history shows that the article is actively edited as there has been at least a couple of edits per week as can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Love_Live!_Sunshine!!&action=history). It was by completely reading through and looking around the article that I was able to notice the mistakes.  

The contributions that I made include editing an invalid date format (which I found in the References section) and editing the grammar of a paragraph (which I found in the Plot section).
